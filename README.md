    "private_data",
    "some_large_directory"
]
```

By default, the extension already excludes common patterns like:
- Build directories (`dist`, `build`, etc.)
- Dependency directories (`node_modules`, etc.)
- System files (`.DS_Store`, etc.)
- Log files (`*.log`, etc.)
- And many more

## Output Format

The copied content follows this Markdown format:

```markdown
# For directories:
Directory Tree:
üìÅ directory_name/
  üìÑ file1.js
  üìÅ subfolder/
    üìÑ file2.js

File Contents:
file1.js
```
console.log('Hello world');
```

file2.js
```
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

# For single files:
